"Between the realms of spirit and physicality
___ is the ___ to solidity of being. Walk the path and cleave to one
regiment, one way of being true to your mind, body and soul.
This is the atlas of your heart"

"Long ago you were born in the village of X. The locals raised you and it was my role to watch over you."

"At a young age you showed courage and splendor. We made a WAY, a set of actions
to be followed that you'd stay strong and one day save the nation from war.
It was then that I named you Atlas, such that you'd cleave to this WAY and stay strong."
"But I was wrong. For as time went on we found our nation had failed us. The nation survived and our people struggled."

"X-nation woke a mechanism inside us and they changed our way of life."
"Stay true to this way and find your place among the stars."
"In time we will come to know our role, be it survival or not."
"And most importantly: Your life and PHYSICAL HEALTH are sacred, so try EACH DAY to take care of yourself."

WHAT IS THE NINJA ATLAS?

Its a 2d, side scrolling rpg with simple-cut old-school graphics. Think a cross between regular nintendo and
super-nintendo but with the color capabilities and styling of modern image technology.

In the-ninja-atlas, the player is told to drink water, eat food, do hard work, pray, meditate,
and build the SELF.
