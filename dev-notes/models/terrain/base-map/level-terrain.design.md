### Metroidvania level-design::

  Levels will include a map of black pixels for the terrain on each level.

  There will be large maps of 256-x-256 pixels each containing 4 smaller maps of
  64-x-64 pixels.

  The terrain of a level is made of all small blocks and the large blocks they rest
  within.

  Large blocks (256) can potentially have a doorway at any of 12 places along the edge.

  Small blocks (64) are the Terrain feature-sets expressing the terrain of the level.


  Some large blocks will consist of only a hallway at the bottom or top of the block.
  Others may consist of only a vertical tower from bottom to top at the right or left
  side.

  The game will consist of many chambers, hallways, and towers with enemies and some puzzles
  throughout.
